# My Spending Insights Dashboard  

## Project Objectives  

As a working individual in Singapore, I am concerned about my living expenses and national expenditure averages. Inflation happens annually worldwide and it will always be a constant worry for citizens of this world. Am I overspending on a specific categories of goods and services? Are my expenses stable? Am I able to predict a stable sum of how much I would spend on food or transportation for the following month?

The aim of the project is to present a summarized view of national and personal expenditure individuals who uses the website. This website serves to inform any individual living and working in Singapore of the national averages in income and expenditures and categories of goods and services most spent on. This is to enable individuals to compare their spending levels against national average and to allow them make informed feedbacks regarding their expenses level.

## UX  

### Overview and Colour
The website has to be clean and pleasing, to achieve its objective of presenting data visually to the user.
The color green (#68ab77) was chosen as this dashboard's primary colour because historically green is the colour of money. Green is used to show national average income levels (bar chart) as well as national average expenditure by goods and services (horizontal bar chart).  

Red (#d8485c) was chosen as a secondary colour. Red is used to show national expenditure levels (in the bar chart) and user entered data because red catches the attention easily. 

Too add attractiveness to the statistics, a dash of other colours are used sparingly in icons and numbers and to colour the lines in the series line chart (to show difference among spending categories).

### Wireframes  
Prior to starting this website, a layout was roughly drawn to visualize the arrangements of the charts and information. After which, a wireframe was drawn using AdobeXD. The wireframe can be viewed here.[here](https://github.com/Oraclebun/).
